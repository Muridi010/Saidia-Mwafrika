Hi Geeks. I have a problem here that i kent quite figure it out.
Am attempting to create a java window to act as a paint program(Like Ms Paint in Windows 10).
Initially, it was just displaying the window but it had no ability to paint.
Afterwards, i kinda screwed up. now it is not running @ all. Just displays a bunch of errors. Quite disappointing... 
After consulting a lecturer, he told me to google Components in Java. 
I don't know what components to use. 
If you solve the problem, av got a reward 4 you! Kshs 50 Airtime,,, Just like that!!
